I am a lecturer in psychology at City, University of London, where I work on statistical data analysis methods for cognitive neuroscience and psychology, and teach about statistical methods and their implementation in Matlab, R, and Python.

My repositories contain

-  implementations of methods developed by me, e.g. [Cross-validated Cross-MANOVA](https://github.com/allefeld/cvcrossmanova), [Cross-validated MANOVA](https://github.com/allefeld/cvmanova), [permutation-based prevalence inference](https://github.com/allefeld/prevalence-permutation), and the [identfication of metastable macrostates](https://github.com/allefeld/metastable-macrostates);
-  software useful for academic work, e.g. a [Jupyter Kernel for Matlab](https://github.com/allefeld/mkernel), a [Python interface to TikZ](https://github.com/allefeld/pytikz), a [Matlab interface to TikZ](https://github.com/allefeld/tikzfig), and [functions to visualize brain MR images for Matlab](https://github.com/allefeld/mrivis);
-  and a [web app to assist in the teaching of statistical methods](https://github.com/allefeld/tykhe).

I also use GitHub to publish my [personal academic home page](https://allefeld.github.io/) and a [random collection of nerdy notes]([https://github.com/allefeld/nerd-notes](https://allefeld.github.io/nerd-notes/)).
